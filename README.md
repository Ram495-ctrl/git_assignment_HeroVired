Repository Setup

<h1> 1. Clone the Repository: <h1>
git clone https://github.com/Ram495-ctrl/git_assignment_HeroVired.git
Cloning into 'git_assignment_HeroVired'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.

remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.

<h1> 
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: 
  
cd git_assignment_HeroVired
<h1> Branch Management <h1>
<h1> 1. Create a New Branch: <h1>
    git checkout -b dev
<h1> 2. Create an Application File: <h1>
    nano CalculatorPlus.py
<h1> 3. Track the New File: <h1>
    git add .
<h1> 4. Commit the New File: <h1>
git commit -m "Initial commit of the Calc plus app on Dev"
<h1> 5. Push the Branch to Remote: <h1>
git push origin dev
<h1> 6. Merge dev Branch to main: <h1>
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main
<h1> Feature Implementation <h1>
1. Create a Feature Branch:
 
git checkout -b feature/sqrt

2. Add Square Root Functionality:

nano CalculatorPlus.py

<h1> 3. Commit Changes in Feature Branch: <h1>
git commit -m "Adding sqrt code to the calc plus app in the feature branch"
<h1> 4. Switch to dev Branch and Fix Bugs: <h1>
  
git checkout dev

nano CalculatorPlus.py

git add CalculatorPlus.py

git commit -m "Adding the bug fix for division code in dev branch"

git push origin dev

<h1> Merging and Releases <h1>
<h1> 1.  Merge Feature Branch to dev: <h1>

* Raise a pull request from feature/sqrt to dev.

<h1> Solution for question 2: <h1>

<h1> Initialize Git LFS in Your Repository <h1>
git lfs install
  
<h1> Track the Large Files <h1>
  
started track the large file:

git lfs track "*.bin"

<h1> Add, Commit, and Push Files <h1>

git add .gitattributes

git add 300MB_Ram.bin

git commit -m "Add large binary file Ram with Git LFS"

git push origin main
